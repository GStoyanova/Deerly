    <h2>Flow diagram</h2>
    <p> Our website consists of four main pages (Home, Products, About Us, and Contacts) for the visitors and one Justivication page, where all of the design choices we've made are explained. <br>
    On the Home page, the first thing a visitor see is a clear call to action to check our product catalog and order. There are also two pictures and and one sentance about our brand. <br>
    The Products page consists of pictures of our products, description and an Order button, that will lead to a Cart page, that is still unavailable. There are also testimonials from clients. <br>
    The About Us page is made to get the customers more familiar with the brand. It will contain our logo, vision and also more info about our team. <br>
    The Contacts page makes contacting us easier for clients, as there they can directly send us a message and also find links to our social media accounts, our email and actual address. <br>
    Users can easily navigate through the pages using the navigation bar, which allows them to choose any page, no matter which one they are currently on.</p></section></div><br></div>

        <h2>Colors</h2>
        <p>For our color palette, we chose feminine and aesthetically pleasing colors that also represent nature. The green and the peachy colors, are our main ones used for text and buttons. However, we also wanted to create a feeling of liveliness and freedom, that is why we used light blue for background color of the whole website body. This palette is our portrayal of the cleanness of our products. We stand for organic ingredients, so this is how we decided on showcasing this statement.</p> </section> </div> <br> <br>

      <h2>Fonts</h2>
      <p>The fonts we chose are rather feminine but also easy to read. We wanted to keep the fonts as clean and simplistic as possible, in order to stick to the minimalistic design of the website. <br>However, we also wanted to create contrast between the fonts and make them stand out more and be easier to read. That is why we added another font - Bebas Neue. It is bolder than the original ones from the Brand Road Map and creates contast, however, manages to create the feeling we want to and matches the overal design. 
      <br>The fonts create the feeling of stability and soft-touch at the same time. We used them not only for the website, but also for the content on our social media platforms. They are original and unique. Therefore, they are a part of our brand concept. We hope that our clients will connect those fonts to our brand only.</p> </section> </div>

 <p> On these pictures you can see the paper prototype of our website. We split it into four main pages and every single one of them showcases their practicalities. We used those pictures for the User Testing. </p>

<div class="container-fluid">
  <h2> User Testing Results </h2>

  <p>Person 1:Said she would like to add products to her favorites.</p>
  <p>Person 2:Said to add more information about the brand and its goals and vision on the ‘about’ page.</p> 
  <p>Person 3:Said he would like to have a basket icon and an option to log in to his account.</p>
  <p>Person 4:Suggested adding jumping windows with ingredients used to create a certain product.</p>
  <p>Person 5:Recommended to have more information on the team and the brand itself on the About Us page.</p>
  <p>Person 6:Said we should keep the design simple and clean as it is now.</p>  
  <p>Person 7:Would love to have a cart where all his products would be stored in one place.</p> 
  <p>Person 8:Recommended to Put the about us after products. He said that the Order button could be “Learn more”.</p>
</div>

<div class="container-fluid">
  <h2>What we've changed</h2>
  <p> Based on the results from the User Testing, we decided to implement some of the feedback and created a cart page. It will be visible when people will be transfered to it when they try to purchase something. As currently it is not possible for us to make a functional cart, we created a page that informs the customers that it is still not availabble. <br>
  Another thing we decided to change is that we changed the order of the pages in the navigation bar and put The ABout Us page after Products and the Justification one we put at the end. The previous order created some confusion in the people who tested the prototype. <br>
  We also put Home next to Deerly, as some people are also confused about this and weren't sure if this is the actual Home page. <br>
  Overall, we made sure to keep the design simple and clean as people liked the minimalistic design and they stated that it makes the website clear and easy to navigate.</p>
